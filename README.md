ðŸš€ Hello everyone, I'm excited to share that I'm diving into #100DaysOfDeepLearning to strengthen my foundations as well as help others who are wondering where to, how to start their Deep Learning journey.

ðŸ’¬ I will be starting this journey from the basics of DL so that any one with minimum knowledge regarding machine learning can follow. So, I will start with the famous Andrew NG's Deep Learning Specialization Course along with the book Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch.


*Note: I have studied about these topics in detail but obviously, it is not feasible to include all the things I learnt here. So, I hope that you will also learn these things from the course and the book yourself thoroughly.*

## Day 1

Starting our #Day1 of #100DaysOfDeepLearning, here are the few things I learned today from the course:

- Neural Network: Basically an architecture which consists of nodes(or neurons), layers and weights. Basically, input nodes receive information, hidden layers process it, and output nodes produce the final result.

- Then I learned about supervised learning with neural network, their applications. There are: (a)Structured Data - eg: Housing Data (b)Unstructured data - eg: text, audio, image.

- Later in the course, Andrew explains about why deep learning is being popular more and more. He uses the following graph to illustrate it.

- He talks about how there are more data, more better computational hardware and  better research algorithm which will all contribute in significant amount of advancements in Deep Learning field for a long time in future too.

## Day 2

Continuing the day 2 of my 100DaysOfDeepLearning, today I learned about binary classification and how to apply logistic regression for the binary classification. I learned about the need of sigmoid function, how to learn weight and biases for accurate predictions. Furthermore, I learned about loss function and cost function of logistic regression - the main difference between them. I have posted a short summary of the things I learned in the linkedin and also the python implementation. You can check it out [**here**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/drishya-karki_day2-activity-7130925730271547392-KOjz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android) I hope you will also give your time to study about these topics following the Deep Learning Specialization course. Looking forward to the days ahead! [**Deep Learning Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

## Day 3

On the third day of #100daysofdeeplearning, today I learned about gradient descent, how it is derived and also implemented logistic regression gradient descent in python. I also learned about computation graph and derivatives with computation graph.I have posted a short summary of the things I learned in the linkedin. You can check it out [**here**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/drishya-karki_day3-activity-7131293446408966144-9P_I?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). I hope you will also spend some time to study about these topics following the [**Deep Learning Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) course. Looking forward to the days ahead!

## Day 4

Today I learned about vectorization - an important technique which helps in performing operations quite faster rather than the typical **for loops**. It enables parallelization on both CPU and GPU. I learned about its importance, how it can help in reducing computational cost and make it more efficient, implemented it for forward propagation as well as backward propagation of logistic regression. It is recommended to implement vectorization rather than explicit for loops whenever possible. It introduces SIMD(Single Instruction Multiple Data). Below are the python implementation of the things I learned. Excited for the coming days! Happy Learning :)

## Day 5

**Broadcasting** is a very important concept to understand in numpy which is very useful for performing mathematical operations between arrays of different shapes. Continuing my journey on the 5th day, I learned about broadcasting and its role, common steps for preprocessing a new dataset, how to build parts of your algorithms, helper functions, forward and backward propagation along with optimization. Below is the python implementation of the things I learned. I have also started learning from the book [**Dive into Deep Learning**](https://d2l.ai/). Excited for the coming days! Happy Learning :)
