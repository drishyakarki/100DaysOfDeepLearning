ðŸš€ Hello everyone, I'm excited to share that I'm diving into #100DaysOfDeepLearning to strengthen my foundations as well as help others who are wondering where to, how to start their Deep Learning journey.

ðŸ’¬ I will be starting this journey from the basics of DL so that any one with minimum knowledge regarding machine learning can follow. So, I will start with the famous Andrew NG's Deep Learning Specialization Course along with the book Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch.


*Note: I have studied about these topics in detail but obviously, it is not feasible to include all the things I learnt here. So, I hope that you will also learn these things from the course and the book yourself thoroughly.*

## Day 1

Starting our #Day1 of #100DaysOfDeepLearning, here are the few things I learned today from the course:

- Neural Network: Basically an architecture which consists of nodes(or neurons), layers and weights. Basically, input nodes receive information, hidden layers process it, and output nodes produce the final result.

- Then I learned about supervised learning with neural network, their applications. There are: (a)Structured Data - eg: Housing Data (b)Unstructured data - eg: text, audio, image.

- Later in the course, Andrew explains about why deep learning is being popular more and more. He uses the following graph to illustrate it.

- He talks about how there are more data, more better computational hardware and  better research algorithm which will all contribute in significant amount of advancements in Deep Learning field for a long time in future too.

## Day 2

Continuing the day 2 of my 100DaysOfDeepLearning, today I learned about binary classification and how to apply logistic regression for the binary classification. I learned about the need of sigmoid function, how to learn weight and biases for accurate predictions. Furthermore, I learned about loss function and cost function of logistic regression - the main difference between them. I have posted a short summary of the things I learned in the linkedin and also the python implementation. You can check it out [**here**]() I hope you will also give your time to study about these topics following the Deep Learning Specialization course. Looking forward to the days ahead!
