ðŸš€ Hello everyone, I'm excited to share that I'm diving into #100DaysOfDeepLearning to strengthen my foundations as well as help others who are wondering where to, how to start their Deep Learning journey.

ðŸ’¬ I will be starting this journey from the basics of DL so that any one with minimum knowledge regarding machine learning can follow. So, I will start with the famous Andrew NG's Deep Learning Specialization Course along with the book Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch.


*Note: I have studied about these topics in detail but obviously, it is not feasible to include all the things I learnt here. So, I hope that you will also learn these things from the course and the book yourself thoroughly.*

## Day 1

Starting our #Day1 of #100DaysOfDeepLearning, here are the few things I learned today from the course:

- Neural Network: Basically an architecture which consists of nodes(or neurons), layers and weights. Basically, input nodes receive information, hidden layers process it, and output nodes produce the final result.

- Then I learned about supervised learning with neural network, their applications. There are: (a)Structured Data - eg: Housing Data (b)Unstructured data - eg: text, audio, image.

- Later in the course, Andrew explains about why deep learning is being popular more and more. He uses the following graph to illustrate it.

I learned about its importance, how it can help in reducing computational cost and make it more efficient, implemented it for forward propagation as well as backward propagation of logistic regression. It is recommended to implement vectorization rather than explicit for loops whenever possible. It introduces SIMD(Single Instruction Multiple Data).

## Day 14

Our from-scratch implementations was designed to provide insight into how each components work. But for writing production code and using RNNs every day, we will want to rely more on libraries that provide us efficiency in both implentation time as well as computation time. Today, on the day 14th of #100daysofdeeplearning, I learned and implemented RNNs concisely by high-level APIs on the Time Machine Dataset.

## Day 15

Shortly after the first RNNs were trained using backpropagation, the problems of learning long-term dependencies(vanishing and exploding gradients) became noticeable. Gradient Clipping helped with exploding gradients but addressing vanishing gradients required more elaborate solutions. One of the first and most successful techniques for addressing vanishing gradients came in the form of LSTM(Long short-term memory) model. They have three types of gates: input, forget and output gates that control the flow of information. Later as LSTM architecture gained popularity, number of researchers experimented with it to simplify the architecture. As a result of such initiative, Gated Recurrent Units(GRUs) were introduced which often achieves comparable performance as that of LSTMs but with the advantage of faster computation. Here, the LSTMs gates are replaced by two gates: reset and update gates. Also, deep RNNs were introduced which involved stacking multiple layers of RNNs to create a deep architecture. We often constuct RNNs that are deep not only in the time direction but also in the input-to-output direction.
Below is the snapshot of concise implementation of some of the RNNs architectures such as LSTMs, GRUs, Deep RNNs. You can check out the from-scratch implementation and the predictions in the notebook. Hope you will also spend some time learning about these topics from the book [**Dive into Deep Learning**](https://d2l.ai/) itself. Keep Learning :)

## Day 16

As modern RNNs gain popularity, one of the major breakthroughs was in the applied field of statistical machine translation. Here, the model is presented with a sentence in one language and must predict the corresponding sentence in another even though the sentences may be of different lengths and the corresponding words in the two sentences may not occur in the same order. On the day-16 of my #100daysofdeeplearning, today I learned about the machine translation problem and an example dataset (English-French dataset). I implemented different data preprocessing techniques, tokenization, loading sequences of fixed length, padding. Using word-level tokenization the vocab size will be significantly larger than using character-level tokenization, but the sequence lengths will be much shorter. To mitigate the large vocabulary size, we treat infrequent tokens as "unknown" tokens.
Below is the snapshot of the code. You can check out the full implementation and the results in the notebook. Hope you will also spend some time learning about these topics from the book [**Dive into Deep Learning**](https://d2l.ai/) itself. Keep Learning :)

## Day 17

Encoder-decoder architectires can handle inputs and outputs that both consist of variable-length sequences and thus are suitable for sequence-to-sequence problems such as machine translation. The encoder takes a variable-length sequence as input and transforms it into a state with a fixed shape. The decoder maps the encoded state of a fixed shape to a variable-length sequence. Following the design of the encoder--decoder architecture, we can use two RNNs to design a model for sequence-to-sequence learning. In encoder--decoder training, the teacher forcing approach feeds original output sequences (in contrast to predictions) into the decoder.When implementing the encoder and the decoder, we can use multilayer RNNs. We can use masks to filter out irrelevant computations, such as when calculating the loss. Today, I learned about encoder-decoder, sequence to sequence architecture, beam search, exhaustive search and greedy search.
Below is the snapshot of the code. You can check out the full implementation and the results in the notebook. Hope you will also spend some time learning about these topics from the book [**Dive into Deep Learning**](https://d2l.ai/) itself. Keep Learning :)

## Day 18

The Transformer is an instance of the encoder--decoder architecture,though either the encoder or the decoder can be used individually in practice. In the Transformer architecture, multi-head self-attention is used
for representing the input sequence and the output sequence, though the decoder has to preserve the autoregressive property via a masked version. On the 18th day, I learned about attention machanisms and transformers. I covered various topics such as kernels, attention pooling, scaled dot product attention, masked softmax operation, additive attention, bahdanu attention mechanism, multi-head attention, self-attention, positional encodeing and many more.
Below is the snapshot of the architecture of encoder and decoder of the transformer. You can check out the full implementation and the results in the notebook.

## Day 19

The Transformer architecture was initially proposed for sequence-to-sequence learning.Naturally, researchers started to wonder if it might be possible to do better by adapting transformer models to image data instead of CNN. Vision Transformers(ViTs) extract patches from images and feed them into a Transformer encoder to obtain a global representation, which will finally be transformed for classification. Notably, the transformers show better scalability than CNNs.Today, I studied about vision transformers, large scale pretraining with transformers, different pretrained transformers such as BERT, T5, BART, GPTs, large language models and so on.

In deep learning, datasets and models are usually large, which involves heavy computation. So, computational performance matters a lot.On the day-21 of #100daysofdeeplearning, today I studied about various factors that affect computational performance: imperative programming, symbollic programming, asynchronous computing, automatic parallelism, and multi-GPU computation. They may further improve computational performance of the models like - by reducing training time without affecting accuracy.

## Day 22

Whether it is medical diagnosis, self-driving vehicles, camera monitoring, or smart filters, many applications in the field of computer vision are closely related to our current and future lives. In recent years, deep learning has been the transformative power for advancing the performance of computer vision systems. It can be said that the most advanced computer vision applications are almost inseparable from deep learning. Today, on the 22<sup>nd</sup> day, I studied and implemented various image augmentation methods, trained with image augmentation, finetuned resenet model for hot dog recognition.

## Day 23

Object detection has been widely applied in many fields. For example, self-driving needs to plan traveling routes by detecting the positions of vehicles, pedestrians, roads, and obstacles in the captured video images. Besides, robots may use this technique to detect and localize objects of interest throughout its navigation of an environment. Moreover, security systems may need to detect abnormal objects, such as intruders or bombs. Today, I studied about object detection, bounding boxes, multiple bounding boxes varying scales and aspect ratios centered on each pixel - Anchor boxes, Jaccard index, predicting bounding boxes with Non-Maximum Supression.
Below is the predicted bounding box applied on an image for multiple object detection. I have uploaded full implementation on my github repo. Hope you will also spend some time learning about these topics from the book [**Dive into Deep Learning**](https://d2l.ai/). Keep Learning :)
